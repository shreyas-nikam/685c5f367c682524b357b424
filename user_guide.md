This section allows you to adjust certain actuarial parameters that influence the income protection calculation. These parameters reflect broader economic and risk factors.

2.  **Coverage Duration (Months):** Specify the duration of income protection coverage in months.
3.  **Coverage Percentage:** Define the percentage of the annual salary that will be covered by the income protection policy.
4.  **Beta (Systemic):** This represents the sensitivity of the individual's income to systematic risk factors, such as economic downturns.
5.  **Beta (Individual):** This represents the sensitivity of the individual's income to individual risk factors, such as job loss.
6.  **Loading Factor:** This is a multiplier applied to the risk-adjusted premium to cover the insurance company's administrative costs and profit margin.
7.  **Minimum Premium:** This represents the minimum premium that the insurance company will charge.
8.  **TTV Period:** Time to Value - expected return on investment.
9.  **Economic Climate:** This reflects the overall health of the economy. A stronger economy generally reduces the risk of job loss.
10. **AI Innovation:** This factor accounts for the potential impact of artificial intelligence on job displacement and earning potential.

## Understanding the Premium Calculation

After setting all the parameters, the application calculates the estimated income protection premium. The premium is influenced by:

*   **Individual Risk:** This reflects the risk of income loss due to factors like occupation, education, and company type.
*   **Systemic Risk:** This considers the impact of broader economic factors on income stability.
*   **Actuarial Parameters:** These are the parameters that are directly entered into the model, like annual salary, and coverage percentage.

Carefully analyze how each parameter contributes to the final premium. You can adjust the parameters and observe the changes in the premium to gain a better understanding of the factors driving income protection costs.
