# Streamlit Application: Simple Data Explorer

## Project Title and Description

This Streamlit application, "Simple Data Explorer," provides a user-friendly interface for loading and exploring CSV data. It allows users to upload a CSV file, view the data in a tabular format, display basic descriptive statistics, and generate a simple data visualization (scatter plot). This application is designed to be a quick and easy way to get a sense of data before diving into more complex analysis. It serves as a fundamental Streamlit project, demonstrating core functionalities like file uploading, data display, and basic plotting.

## Features

*   **CSV Upload**: Allows users to upload CSV files directly into the application.
*   **Data Display**:  Displays the uploaded data as an interactive table using Streamlit's `dataframe` function.
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculates and displays basic descriptive statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles) for numerical columns.
*   **Scatter Plot Generation**: Generates a simple scatter plot, allowing users to choose which columns to plot on the x and y axes.
*   **User-Friendly Interface**:  Simple and intuitive interface for easy data exploration.
*   **Error Handling**:  Provides basic error handling for invalid file uploads and column selections.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.  Ensure you have Python version 3.7 or higher.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (Optional if you only have the Streamlit application code)**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **On macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required packages:**

    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    matplotlib
    ```

    Then, install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    Navigate to the directory containing the Streamlit application file (`your_app_name.py` - if you just have the code, place it in a directory of your choosing) and run the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run your_app_name.py  # Replace your_app_name.py with the actual filename
    ```

2.  **Using the Application:**

    *   The application will open in your web browser.
    *   Click the "Browse files" button to upload a CSV file.
    *   The uploaded data will be displayed in a table.
    *   Descriptive statistics will be shown below the table.
    *   Use the dropdown menus to select the columns for the x and y axes of the scatter plot.
    *   The generated scatter plot will be displayed.
